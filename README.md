# Formal-Proofs-Addition-is-Commutative

This is a collection of (formal) proofs that *addition on natural numbers is commutative*, that is, 

> `m + n = n + m` for all natural numbers `m` and `n`

in various proof assistants. 

## Why do this?

The commutativity of addition on natural numbers is a more appropriate "first proof" or "first program/script" for proof assistants, than the typical "Hello World!" program. Many proof assistants are not primarily focused on input/output or even *running* the program, as opposed to just typechecking it. This makes "Hello World!" programs a little awkward and not particularly illustrative of the differences between proof assistants.

## I've got something to add!

Contributions are welcome! Implementations of the proof in any proof assistant or programming language are always desired, as are corrections to existing proofs or alternate solutions that illustrate a different technique or facet of the language (e.g. one that uses raw proof terms vs. one that relies primarily on tactics).
