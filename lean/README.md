# add_comm in Lean

A proof that addition is commutative for the natural numbers in Lean is typically proven by using tactics. We provide such a proof in `add_comm.lean`, following [the appropriate section](http://leanprover.github.io/logic_and_proof/the_natural_numbers_and_induction_in_lean.html#defining-the-arithmetic-operations-in-lean) of the *Logic and Proof* text by Jeremy Avidgad, Floris van Doorn, and Robert Lewis.
